# 👋 Hi, I'm Masoud Bakhshi

I’m a **Control Software Specialist at Volvo Trucks**, working at the intersection of electric powertrain innovation, control engineering, and sustainable mobility. My focus is on designing robust, high-performance control systems for electric vehicles — specifically in the areas of **vector control**, **torque optimization**, and **regenerative braking** for **PMSM** and **EESM** machines.

With a background in both academic research and applied R&D, I strive to bridge theory and real-world implementation, developing advanced control architectures that are not only efficient and scalable, but also safe and production-ready.

## 🧭 Areas of Expertise

- Field-Oriented Control (FOC) for PMSM/IPMSM and EESM drives
- Regenerative braking and energy recovery optimization
- Adaptive PI and AI-assisted controller design
- System-level integration of propulsion control for commercial EVs
- Embedded software for real-time, safety-critical systems

## 🧠 Innovation & IP

My recent work has contributed to the development of **adaptive reference generation** techniques and **constraint-aware control logic** for heavy-duty electric trucks. Several of these solutions are now protected under **granted European patents** and integrated into Volvo’s next-generation propulsion platforms.
